# Hitchhike Hazie

## Take the scenic route.

**Hitchhike Hazie** is a travel blog and project portfolio.  
This MVP of the site is a work in progress, built with Create-react-app.  
I previously built this site on WordPress, but am glad to build it myself from scratch with code this time.  
Lots of photos and information!
