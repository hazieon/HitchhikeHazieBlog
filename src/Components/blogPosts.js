      summary:
        "Since 99% of the South Korean population eat meat, vegetarianism is generally unknown. This can make it hard to find vegetarian/vegan friendly restaurants or places to eat with friends. Here are my top 10 restaurant recommendations for Seoul!",
      content: {
        textOne: `The hardest part of being vegetarian in Korea isn’t about the food… It’s the missing social life. Friends will often want to meet up for BBQ 삼겹살 or celebrate an event with a round of ‘chicken and beer’ 치맥. Since 99% of the South Korean population eat meat, vegetarianism is generally unknown. 

Many social events will end with a group dinner (almost certainly a meat feast). And, when even kimchi has fish in it, it can be hard avoid meat AND have a social life… (friends and restaurant staff often don’t even know what is suitable for vegetarians/vegans). `,
        textTwo: `So, I did all the researching and testing for you. Here I present to you a selection of places you can visit with your carnivorous friends, and still find plenty to eat for yourself. 
          
Restaurant/food options for BOTH meat eaters AND vegetarians to enjoy! `,
        textThree: `How to avoid being an isolated vegetarian in Korea: 

       1. SUBWAY (vegan + vegetarian)
         
It’s not Korean food, but it’s fairly cheap and it’s a chain so you can find it almost everywhere! There are both vegetarian and vegan options available, and the staff almost always speak English to prepare your order. I often go for the egg mayo, but avocado is also available! 
Vegans: be sure to specify that you don’t want cheese and avoid the honey bread! 

         
        2. BAKERIES
Paris baguette/Tous Les Jours/Hot Bread/Krispy Kreme/Dunkin Donuts/Other bakery [vegetarian] 
         
Also not Korean food, but has a nice selection for us Europeans. A variety of breads, sweet and savoury. I like the red bean bread, sesame bread, cinnamon rolls and bagels. 

Doughnuts can be a nice treat, too. Many vegetarian options, but check the labels!! (look for ‘고기’ in the allergy list!) Any filled or pizza breads usually contain meat! 

Never be misled by the word ‘vegetable’ on packaging. 

There are still plenty of things available to grab a nice brunch or lunch or take a nice café break! Also look out for independent, non-chain shops selling croquettes or breads! 
         

         3. LOVING HUT (vegan)
         
Although this restaurant is exclusively vegan food, it deserves a mention. This chain restaurant has a few different branches around Seoul, mostly in the Gangnam area. They serve typical Korean dishes, but using soy meat in place of actual meat. This is great because it means you can try out Korean dishes and your carnivorous friends can get some familiar food too. They might not think it tastes the same as meat, but they can still enjoy it. Try out some vegan ‘chicken’, 라면ramyeon noodles or even 불고기 bulgogi ‘beef’. 

http://www.lovinghut.kr/kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=restaurants_kr_en&lang=_en 

         
         4. BIBIRI Bibimbap 비비리 – (or other bibimbap restaurants) 

Bibiri is an all-you-can-eat Bibimbap restaurant.
There are two branches in Hongdae, Mapo-gu, central Seoul. Here you can eat 비빔빕 bibimbap it build-it-yourself style! What’s more, it’s a free refill buffet! Healthy, big, quick + cheap meal in a good location! It’s also open til 10pm. What more do you need before hitting the bars? 
Vegetarians avoid adding the mincemeat and vegans avoid the eggs too. 

According to the staff, the red pepper pastes and soy sauce is vegan-safe, but the soybean paste (된장, light brown colour) has some sort of meat. 
           

        5. TTEOKBOKKI 두끼떡볶이 dukki tteokbokki – 
 All you can eat tteokbokki chain restaurant! 

For around 9000won, you can build your own meal again! 
Add vegetables, various types of 떡tteok (‘rice cakes’) and add noodles or rice. Can you tell I like buffet style? ;) 

There are plenty of vegetables, rice cakes, rice, noodles, eggs, pickles, corn, deep fried sweet potatoes, etc! A great place to eat with friends! 
           
NOTE: NONE of the standard sauces are vegetarian or vegan. The sauces contain meat. After asking staff AND checking the sauce ingredient listings, only the cream sauce is vegetarian (not vegan – also watch out for the white ‘cheese filled’ tteok). But you can also cook your meal with soy sauce (간장). If your carnivore friends need that spicy meat sauce and need to add sausage to their meal, you can actually add the sauce into your personal dishes and heat them separately.
Extra note: the ‘water’ they add to the dish most likely contains some fish/meat stock, so I usually add water myself... 
           

        6. LOTTERIA – 'Korean McDonald’s'. 

Yes, it serves primarily meat burgers, but you can get potato fries, an apple pie, ice cream, cheese sticks, etc. Or a drink. It’s something, it's cheap, and it provides a place to sit with hungry friends.


      7. 죽 JUK Rice porridge. 
      
Try out 본죽 or 죽이야기 Juk story. 
There are various chain and independent restaurants and cafes that serve Juk for under 9000won. Plus it's Korean food!

Healthy rice porridge dishes with vegetables and beans. Some branches also serve bibimbap rice and noodle dishes. If you can convince your carnivorous friend to get one without meat in it, it’s nice to share two porridge bowls.
Portion sizes are nice and it’s a warming meal! 

Vegetarian/vegan options include: 
팥죽 red bean porridge, 야채죽 vegetable porridge, 
단호박죽 sweet pumpkin porridge, 녹두죽 mung bean porridge, 
흑임자죽 black sesame porridge, 잣죽 pine nut porridge.

My favourites are the red bean, vegetable and sweet pumpkin <3 
I could eat three to myself after an afternoon of taekwondo!
        

      8. DESSERTS 
Cafes + dessert placesChain and independent cafes are everywhere. Grab a coffee, tea, latte, smoothie, juice, whatever you like without even having to look at meat. Yay. They probably serve cookies, cakes or breads too if you’re peckish. 


Vegans should probably ask to make sure their drink doesn’t contain any milk etc. 
        

       9. STREET FOOD STALLS
       
when in a hurry, grab some vegetarian street foods.
계란빵Egg bread, 호떡hotteok pancake – sugar filled; soft or crispy varieties, strawberries with or without chocolate, yakisoba fried noodles, waffles, crepes, tall icecreams, etc.

Try Dongdaemun, Hongdae and Hyehwa districts for plenty of cheap stalls ;)
        

        10. PIZZA –

cheese pizza or vegetable pizza (reminder: don’t be misled by ‘vegetable’, check the toppings before ordering), potato pizza (check toppings), or even sweet potato pizza if you’re up for an experience. Plenty of shops offer pizzas with at least one or two menu options that don’t have meat! 

Try Mr Pizza for something low cost.
Dominoes and Pizza Hut branches should also let you customise your order (if you can communicate with the staff).
        

BONUS TIP - Google search/naver search/happy cow search for nearby vegetarian restaurants upon OCCASION.Some listings have vegetarian/vegan options available as well as meat stuff.If you’re getting peckish, check if there’s anything nearby. If your meat-eating friends are hungry, they might be up to try something new or you can find a place with both.`,

        "Whether you’re an introvert looking for a few close friends, or an extravert searching for the next social hotspot, here are some methods I used when living abroad to make friends!",
      content: {
        textOne: `Living in a foreign country alone can be overwhelming. Whether you’ve just arrived and have no connections or you’ve been there a while, you might have times when you feel isolated or alone.
          That’s okay :) Sometimes it can give you space to do your own thing and get a new viewpoint on things But most of us like company some of the time, even introverts: Whether you’re an introvert that just wants a few friends to hang out with, or an extravert searching for the next social hotspot you can flourish in, here are some methods I used when living in Korea, Japan and Austria to make new friends!! Especially to make local friends!`,
        textTwo: `Language exchange events. 
         Even if you aren’t actively learning the local language, or if you are a native speaker, language exchanges bring together people to mix with. 
         Not only that, but language exchange visitors tend to be more internationally minded and open to other cultures and people. 
         Many people are also focused on making friends and getting to know each other, so it’s the perfect set up!
         
         In my own experience, attending language exchange meetups changed my life in Tokyo and in Seoul!! It meant I made a large number of people outside of my everyday bubble from various backgrounds. 
         I even met some of my close friends that I speak to today :) 
         With that success, I started attending language exchange cafes and bars in Seoul as soon as I arrived. It certainly helped me to get my feet grounded in Korea!! Also, I heard of many people who met their partners at language exchange events.. so who knows?! 
         Good if: you want to meet local people casually 
         Not so good if: you are tired of hearing the same questions you get all the time as a foreigner 
            
         
         Learn the local language – join a language class and pick up the basics. Learn some popular slang or buzz words and impress native speakers. Learning the local language will help you to connect with the place you are living much better; you can get by in daily situations and natives will be warmer to people they see as making effort to understand their country. 
         
         My own experience showed that speaking Japanese was an essential tool. When making friends in Japan, and I found I got along with people much better in Korea after I could understand the basics of the language and culture! 
         There are free classes everywhere and free resources online and so many apps available! 
         Good if: you are staying in the country for a while, you want close friends. 
         Not so good if: There are no downsides with learning a new language, but it can be time consuming or can get confusing to learn a lot of languages simultaneously. 
         
         Step out of the expat bubble ASAP. 
       Getting out your comfort zone of spending time with other foreigners ia big move. Attending events or meetups alone will help you to network and make friends. It can be a bit nerve wracking turning up to an event alone when others seem to be in friend groups, but it will turn out fine. 
       
       After I attended a simple meetup party alone in Tokyo, I didn’t turn back. I ended up hitchhiking and travelling around Japan alone too, but I met so many people along the way, it often didn’t feel lonely at all. 
       Good if: you want to get an authentic experience of the country you are living, you want to go beyond being a tourist 
       Not so good if: you are feeling lonely because you are homesick or feeling alienated`,
        textThree: `Find friends virtually. 
          It’s 2021, so if going out alone in the real world still scares you, you can always try finding Facebook groups based on your interests – for example, language exchange groups or a specific interest. 
          
        I joined a group for vegetarians in both Japan and Korea. 
        I could get information, share information and meet new people. Sometimes these groups hold meetups to attend too. 
        You can also use language exchange apps such as HelloTalk or Tandem. I met a few friends this way! 
        
        Join a club. People can bond with others who share their interests, so clubs or meetups are a perfect way to meet likeminded people. 
        If you enjoy photography or playing tennis or writing stories, or anything at all, there are clubs for you! And if not, why not start something new altogether?! 
        If you are a student, try looking within your school or university first.
        
        In my Japanese university, I joined Japanese and English practice clubs, yoga classes, a taekwondo group, and even attended a stray-cat feeding group just for fun. I met a lot of great friends there, both Japanese and other foreigners! 
        It opened up more opportunities too; to engage in cultural events and visit places together. 
        Look for posters, leaflets or visit your university’s student centre to get information. Send an email to any events or student departments.
        
        In Korea, I took the chance to join an adults Taekwondo dojang! It is a South Korean marital art so it seemed like an invaluable chance to engage in something related to the culture. But it also meant I met a lot of new people, Koreans and other foreigners! I also found an art café to doodle at whilst chatting to new friends. I also joined a skateboarding group to try out boarding for the first time, found an Indie music bar with cool events. Good if: you want friends in general, you are looking for something to do and someone to do it with. Try something new! There are groups for just about anything. Even if you are only in the country for a short while! 
        And if there isn’t a club for your raving new hobby, then that’s also fine: Start a new club or social meetup. 
        Thanks to the internet, you can use platforms to gather people and advertise events. You can organise an event for your raving new hobby and meet in cafes or outdoors or wherever. Start a Meetup event. Host an event.
         Create a Facebook group or hold events in an existing group. 
         Start a university club. 
         In my UK University, I was the event organiser for the Japanese society for two years, which helped to gather people and make new friends for sure! 
         Good if: you can’t find an active club for something you’re interested in, if you’re feeling sociable
         Not so good if: you needn’t make a full on group on Meetup if you’re only visiting for a short while, but that shouldn’t stop you organising an event in an existing group! 
         
         Couchsurfing! Especially for backpackers, Couchsurfing is an amazing tool for finding a place to stay. But it isn’t limited to that. 
         With hundreds of travellers creating profiles, it can be a great place to make friends in any place. There are also hangout meetups held in some areas (or you can always host one yourself). I made a public post when I arrived in Korea simply searching for friends and I met a few good friends this way who I spent time with all year  You can also try hosting people visiting your area and hang out with them! 
         Good if: you like travelling a lot, you find some people with similar interests 
         Not so good if: you are more into luxury or have expensive tastes. 
         
         The final tip for making friends abroad is to be proactive. Not just in meeting new people, but in making and keeping connections. Keep in touch with the friends you made at the language exchange events, organise to meetup with your pals from the clubs you joined, host or attend events with people from the Facebook group, etc etc. Why not invite them to that restaurant you want to try, or to that sightseeing place you still haven’t been to yet. It can be hard to make a connection with people from a completely new culture, but if you make the effort to settle in, it can be easy. You can also start by giving. Share a story, show some photos, share some snacks. People will open up to you if you show yourself! Make some time for socialising and try some new things! 
         
         Sometimes it only takes meeting one new friend to open up opportunities and to help you find new things to do!`,

        "I've hitchhiked over 10 countries in over 200 rides and I learnt a lot along the way. Here is my best advice to get a safe ride.",
      content: {
        textOne: `In most countries, if you tell people you plan to hitchhike, the first thing they will say it is too dangerous. Second they will tell you it’s impossible, especially in that specific country, but that’s another topic. 
          Having hitchhiked in over 10 different countries, I have caught over 200 rides (honestly I have lost count). 
          [Uk, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, bosnia Herzegovina, hungary, japan, korea]
          And since I’m writing this now, it is clear that I am not dead. 
          Infact, I haven’t had one single bad experience whilst hitchhiking!
          `,
        textTwo: `I believe hitchhiking is generally no more dangerous than other day to day activities (being in a moving car in itself is probably much more dangerous than the strangers who are driving it). 
          http://bernd.wechner.info/Hitchhiking/CHP/body.html here’s some research findings
          If you always take care and precautions, you too can hitchhike safely and successfully, instead of ending up like poor HitchBOT (https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/friendly-robot-hitchhiking-across-america-6184914) .
          Here are a few tips on staying safe!:
          
          1.	Do your research
          The general safety of the country you are in will largely affect the safety of hitchhiking there. Hitchhiking in Japan is going to be different to hitchhiking in Colombia. Know the road systems and picking up at least basic phrases in the local language can help a lot.
          
          2.	Read the situation 
          Follow your instincts from the start. Don’t get in the car if the driver or other passengers don’t immediately seem welcoming. 
          Solo female hitchhiker and some snarky guys? Just say no. Another car will come. 
          Some other tips for this are:
          a.	Ask the driver where they are going first – Some drivers may lie about their destination in order to give you a ride. Sometimes they just genuinely want to help you or talk to you, but it can feel shady…
          b.	Agree on a destination before setting off. Compare maps and routes. Choose a city, service station or specific point they will drop you at.
          
          3.	Control the conversation
          Once in the car, talk to your driver as much as you can. I’ve read several accounts of long term long distance hitchhikers who CREDIT their safety to the way they interact with the driver. E.g. Thank them for the safe ride, for their kindness; compliment their country & the kindness of the people, ask about their family, etc. Be confident. The driver can sense if you feel anxious.
          Solo females – If a male driver begins to ask about whether you have a boyfriend, sometimes it is smart to just say yes, even say you are married. Be forward and don’t let them make any advances on you. You don’t owe them anything. 
          I usually tell a driver I hitchhike alone safely because the country is safe and that I know taekwondo 
          4.	Track yourself 
          Have your phone ready. Use GPS and maps if possible. Keep in touch with people who know where you are. You can make your driver aware of this too. If you have chance, take a photo of their car & registration plate. 
          `,
        textThree: `5.	Road safety 
        Not to be forgotten just because you are riding for free! Wear a seatbelt. Don’t walk close to the road. I avoid hitchhiking on corners, on fast road strips or where drivers would need to change lanes in order to pull over. Ask a driver to slow down if you feel unsafe. 
        6.	Nocturnal hitching 
        If hitchhiking at night, stand in well lit places. Long distance lorry/trucks may be best at this time. Be more selective in your rides – you don’t want to be stuck at some roadside in the middle of the night. Best to stay at a service station, or get to your exact destination. Same applies for hitchhiking in extreme temperatures or bad weather. 
        Be sure the driver is not drunk or sleepy!
        
        7.	Luggage 
        I always sit with my backpack beside me. Even if the driver offers to use the boot space or put the bag in the back, I (politely) refuse. Firstly it’s best to keep things near you in case of a quick getaway. Second to have access to your things like your phone, maps and chargers. I also take my bag with me even if making a short stop over. 
        Don’t forget your hitchhike sign when you get out, too. Losing the sign can create a problem mid-trip as I learnt… twice.
        8.	Insurance 
        If something does go wrong.. Insurance can help with both broken devices, and broken bones.  
        9.	Smile 
        Being friendly when hitchhiking can go a long way. Just don’t be afraid to stick to your comfort level. Now relax and enjoy hitchhiking safely. Let the next adventure begin!
