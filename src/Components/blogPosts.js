        "Top Ten: Since 99% of the South Korean population eat meat, vegetarianism is generally unknown. This can make it hard to find vegetarian/vegan friendly restaurants or places to eat with friends. Here are my top 10 restaurant recommendations for Seoul!",
      content: {
        textOne: `The hardest part of being vegetarian in Korea isn’t about the food… It’s the missing social life. Friends will often want to meet up for BBQ 삼겹살 or celebrate an event with a round of ‘chicken and beer’ 치맥. Since 99% of the South Korean population eat meat, vegetarianism is generally unknown. 

Many social events will end with a group dinner (almost certainly a meat feast). And, when even kimchi has fish in it, it can be hard avoid meat AND have a social life… (friends and restaurant staff often don’t even know what is suitable for vegetarians/vegans). `,
        textTwo: `So, I did all the researching and testing for you. Here I present to you a selection of places you can visit with your carnivorous friends, and still find plenty to eat for yourself. 
          
Restaurant/food options for BOTH meat eaters AND vegetarians to enjoy! 

How to avoid being an isolated vegetarian in Korea: 

       1. SUBWAY (vegan + vegetarian) - 
         
It’s not Korean food, but it’s fairly cheap and it’s a chain so you can find it almost everywhere! There are both vegetarian and vegan options available, and the staff almost always speak English to prepare your order. I often go for the egg mayo, but avocado is also available! 
Vegans: be sure to specify that you don’t want cheese and avoid the honey bread! 

         
        2. BAKERIES - 
Paris baguette/Tous Les Jours/Hot Bread/Krispy Kreme/Dunkin Donuts/Other bakery [vegetarian] 
         
Also not Korean food, but has a nice selection for us Europeans. A variety of breads, sweet and savoury. I like the red bean bread, sesame bread, cinnamon rolls and bagels. 

Doughnuts can be a nice treat, too. Many vegetarian options, but check the labels!! (look for ‘고기’ in the allergy list!) Any filled or pizza breads usually contain meat! 

Never be misled by the word ‘vegetable’ on packaging. 

There are still plenty of things available to grab a nice brunch or lunch or take a nice café break! Also look out for independent, non-chain shops selling croquettes or breads! `,
        textThree: `
         3. LOVING HUT (vegan) - 
         
Although this restaurant is exclusively vegan food, it deserves a mention. This chain restaurant has a few different branches around Seoul, mostly in the Gangnam area. They serve typical Korean dishes, but using soy meat in place of actual meat. This is great because it means you can try out Korean dishes and your carnivorous friends can get some familiar food too. They might not think it tastes the same as meat, but they can still enjoy it. Try out some vegan ‘chicken’, 라면ramyeon noodles or even 불고기 bulgogi ‘beef’. 

http://www.lovinghut.kr/kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=restaurants_kr_en&lang=_en 

         
         4. BIBIRI Bibimbap 비비리 – (or other bibimbap restaurants) - 

Bibiri is an all-you-can-eat Bibimbap restaurant.
There are two branches in Hongdae, Mapo-gu, central Seoul. Here you can eat 비빔빕 bibimbap it build-it-yourself style! What’s more, it’s a free refill buffet! Healthy, big, quick + cheap meal in a good location! It’s also open til 10pm. What more do you need before hitting the bars? 
Vegetarians avoid adding the mincemeat and vegans avoid the eggs too. 

According to the staff, the red pepper pastes and soy sauce is vegan-safe, but the soybean paste (된장, light brown colour) has some sort of meat. 
           

        5. TTEOKBOKKI 두끼떡볶이 dukki tteokbokki – 
 All you can eat tteokbokki chain restaurant! 

For around 9000won, you can build your own meal again! 
Add vegetables, various types of 떡tteok (‘rice cakes’) and add noodles or rice. Can you tell I like buffet style? ;) 

There are plenty of vegetables, rice cakes, rice, noodles, eggs, pickles, corn, deep fried sweet potatoes, etc! A great place to eat with friends! 
           
NOTE: NONE of the standard sauces are vegetarian or vegan. The sauces contain meat. After asking staff AND checking the sauce ingredient listings, only the cream sauce is vegetarian (not vegan – also watch out for the white ‘cheese filled’ tteok). But you can also cook your meal with soy sauce (간장). If your carnivore friends need that spicy meat sauce and need to add sausage to their meal, you can actually add the sauce into your personal dishes and heat them separately.
Extra note: the ‘water’ they add to the dish most likely contains some fish/meat stock, so I usually add water myself... 
           

        6. LOTTERIA – 'Korean McDonald’s' - 

Yes, it serves primarily meat burgers, but you can get potato fries, an apple pie, ice cream, cheese sticks, etc. Or a drink. It’s something, it's cheap, and it provides a place to sit with hungry friends.


      7. 죽 JUK RICE PORRIDGE - 
      
Try out 본죽 or 죽이야기 Juk story. 
There are various chain and independent restaurants and cafes that serve Juk for under 9000won. Plus it's Korean food!

Healthy rice porridge dishes with vegetables and beans. Some branches also serve bibimbap rice and noodle dishes. If you can convince your carnivorous friend to get one without meat in it, it’s nice to share two porridge bowls.
Portion sizes are nice and it’s a warming meal! 

Vegetarian/vegan options include: 
팥죽 red bean porridge, 야채죽 vegetable porridge, 
단호박죽 sweet pumpkin porridge, 녹두죽 mung bean porridge, 
흑임자죽 black sesame porridge, 잣죽 pine nut porridge.

My favourites are the red bean, vegetable and sweet pumpkin <3 
I could eat three to myself after an afternoon of taekwondo!
        
        8. 사찰음식 TRADITIONAL BUDDHIST CUISINE -
Despite the fact that most young Koreans have never heard of vegetarians, Korea didn't actually serve meat as a staple until recent years. Things have changed. But Buddhist-style restaurants can still be found, particularly near temples and in traditional areas, such as Jongro-3 in Seoul. There are buffet places too. Super healthy and enjoyed by Koreans, vegetarians and vegans.
        

       9. STREET FOOD STALLS -
       
when in a hurry, grab some vegetarian street foods.
계란빵Egg bread, 호떡hotteok pancake – sugar filled; soft or crispy varieties, strawberries with or without chocolate, yakisoba fried noodles, waffles, crepes, tall icecreams, etc.

Try Dongdaemun, Hongdae and Hyehwa districts for plenty of cheap stalls ;)
        

        10. PIZZA –

cheese pizza or vegetable pizza (reminder: don’t be misled by ‘vegetable’, check the toppings before ordering), potato pizza (check toppings), or even sweet potato pizza if you’re up for an experience. Plenty of shops offer pizzas with at least one or two menu options that don’t have meat! 

Try Mr Pizza for something low cost.
Dominoes and Pizza Hut branches should also let you customise your order (if you can communicate with the staff).
        

        DESSERTS - 
Got to finish with something sweet, right? Cafes + dessert places.
Chain and independent cafes are everywhere. Grab a coffee, tea, latte, smoothie, juice, whatever you like without even having to look at meat. Yay. Also try 설빙 Sulbing for some delicious 빙수 shaved ice!
Depending on the season, fruits can be fairly affordable too! Try peaches, persimmons and watermelons!
        


      BONUS TIP - 
Google search/naver search/happy cow search for nearby vegetarian restaurants upon OCCASION.Some listings have vegetarian/vegan options available as well as meat stuff.If you’re getting peckish, check if there’s anything nearby. If your meat-eating friends are hungry, they might be up to try something new or you can find a place with both.`,

      summary:
        "Top Tips: Whether you’re an introvert looking for a few close friends, or an extravert searching for the next social hotspot, here are some methods I used when living abroad to make friends!",
      content: {
        textOne: `Living in a foreign country alone can be overwhelming. 
Whether you’ve just arrived and have no connections or you’ve been there a while, you might have times when you feel isolated or alone.
That’s okay :) 

Sometimes it can give you space to do your own thing and time to develop new viewpoints on things. However, most of us like company some of the time, even introverts. 

Whether you’re an introvert that just wants a few friends to hang out with, or an extravert searching for the next social hotspot you can flourish in, here are some methods I used when living in Korea, Japan and Austria to make new friends!! Especially to make local friends!`,
        textTwo: `      1. Language exchange events! 
Even if you aren’t actively learning the local language, or if you are a native speaker, language exchanges bring together people to mix with. 
Not only that, but language exchange visitors tend to be more internationally minded and open to other cultures and people. 
 Many people are also focused on making friends and getting to know each other, so it’s the perfect set up!
         
In my own experience, attending language exchange meetups changed my life in Tokyo and in Seoul!! It meant I made a large number of people outside of my everyday bubble from various backgrounds. 
I even met some of my close friends that I speak to today :) 

With that success, I started attending language exchange cafes and bars in Seoul as soon as I arrived. 
It certainly helped me to get my feet grounded in Korea.
Also, I heard of many people who met their partners at language exchange events.. so who knows?! I recommend trying them out.
         
GOOD WHEN: You want to meet local people in a casual setting.    
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: you are tired of hearing the same questions you get all the time as a foreigner.
            
         
      2. Learn the local language! 
Join a language class and pick up the basics. Learn some popular slang or buzz words and impress native speakers. Learning the local language will help you to connect with the place you are living much better; you can get by in daily situations and natives will be warmer to people they see as making effort to understand their country. 
         
In my own experience, learning the local language has been essential. 
When making friends in Japan and Korea, and I found I got along with people much betterafter I could understand the basics of the language and culture. You can understand peoples viewpoints better and reduce the language barrier even with just a little bit of the native language. 

There are free classes everywhere and free resources online and so many apps available if you search! 

GOOD WHEN: You are staying in the country for a while, you want close friends. 
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: It can be time consuming or can get confusing to learn a new language. But I do believe it is worth the work.
         

        3. Step out of that foreigner or expat bubble ASAP!
Getting out your comfort zone of spending time with other foreigners ia big move. Attending events or meetups alone will help you to network and make friends. It can be a bit nerve wracking turning up to an event alone when others seem to be in friend groups, but it will turn out fine. Join activities with local people - meals out, karaoke sessions, festivals, cultural centre events.
       
After I attended one party alone in Tokyo, I didn’t turn back. 
I ended up going solo hitchhiking and travelling around Japan too, but I met so many people along the way, it often didn’t feel lonely at all. 
       
GOOD WHEN: you want to get an authentic experience of the country you are living, you want to go beyond being a tourist 
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: you are feeling lonely because you are homesick or feeling alienated`,
        textThree: `         4. Find friends virtually! 
It’s 2021, so if going out alone in the real world still scares you, you can always try finding Facebook groups based on your interests – for example, language exchange groups or a specific interest. 
          
For example, I joined a group for vegetarians in both Japan and Korea. 
I could get information and meet new people. Sometimes these groups hold meetups to attend too. 
You can also use language exchange apps such as HelloTalk or Tandem. I met a few friends this way! 

GOOD WHEN: You just moved to a new place or want to meet friends outside your everyday bubble.
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: You don't feel safe meeting people from online. 
        
        5. Join a club!
People can bond with others who share their interests, so clubs or meetups are a perfect way to meet likeminded people, breaking down the cultural and language barriers!

If you enjoy photography or playing tennis or writing stories, or anything at all, there are clubs for you! And if not, why not start something new altogether?! 
If you are a student, try looking within your school or university.
        
In my Japanese university, there were loads of 'circles' to join. 
I joined Japanese and English practice clubs, yoga classes, a taekwondo group, and even attended a stray-cat feeding group just for fun. I met a lot of great friends there, both Japanese and other nationalities!

These groups provide other opportunities too, like the chance to engage in cultural events and visit places together. 
        
GOOD WHEN: You want to meet likeminded friends and explore the country, breaking down the language barrier.
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: You live in a rural area without many events or clubs.


      6. Try something new!
There are groups for just about anything. Even if you are only in the country for a short while. And if there isn’t a club for your raving new hobby, then that’s also fine: Start that new club or social meetup! 

We can easily use internet platforms to gather people and advertise events. You can organise an event for your raving new hobby and meet in cafes or outdoors or wherever. Start a social group. Host an event.
Other platforms: Facebook groups, Meetup.com, university events.  

GOOD WHEN: you can’t find an active club for something you’re interested in and you will be living there for a long while.
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: you’re only visiting for a short while, but that shouldn’t put you off organising an event in an existing group! 
         

         7. Couchsurfing! 
Especially for backpackers, Couchsurfing is an amazing tool for finding a place to stay. But it isn’t limited to that. 
With hundreds of travellers creating profiles, it can be a great place to make friends in any place. There are also hangout meetups held in some areas (or you can always host one yourself). I made a public post when I arrived in Korea simply searching for friends and I met a few good friends this way who I spent time with all year  You can also try hosting people visiting your area and hang out with them! 
GOOD WHEN: you like travelling a lot, you find some people with similar interests 
NOT SO GOOD WHEN: you are more into luxury travel or have expensive tastes. 
         
The final tip for making friends abroad is to be proactive. 
Not just in meeting new people, but in making and keeping connections. Keep in touch with the friends you made at the language exchange events, organise to meetup with your pals from the clubs you joined, host or attend events with people from the Facebook group, etc etc. Why not invite them to that restaurant you want to try, or to that sightseeing place you still haven’t been to yet. 

It can be hard to make a connection with people from a completely new culture, but if you make the effort to settle in, it can be easy. 

If feeling lost, you can start by giving. Share a story, show photos, share some snacks. People will open up to you if you show yourself! :) 
         
Sometimes it only takes meeting ONE new friend to open up connections and opportunities to so many exciting things!`,

Having hitchhiked in over 10 different countries, I have caught over 200 rides (honestly I have lost count).

Infact, I haven’t had one single dangerous experience whilst hitchhiking!
          `,
        textTwo: `
I believe hitchhiking is generally no more dangerous than other day to day activities (being in a moving car in itself is probably much more dangerous than the strangers who are driving it). 

Here’re some research findings:
http://bernd.wechner.info/Hitchhiking/CHP/body.html. 

If you take care and precautions, it's possible hitchhike safely and successfully, instead of ending up like poor HitchBOT: 
https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/friendly-robot-hitchhiking-across-america-6184914.

While I don't recommend hitchhiking for everyone, it would be great to dispel some myths.


Here are a few tips on staying safe whilst hitchhiking!:
          
          1.	Do your research -
The general safety of the country you are in will largely affect the safety of hitchhiking there. Hitchhiking in Japan is going to be different to hitchhiking in Colombia. Know the road systems and picking up at least basic phrases in the local language can help a lot.
          

2.	Read the situation -
Follow your instincts from the start. Don’t get in the car if the driver or other passengers don’t immediately seem welcoming. 
Some snarky guys offering a ride? Just say no. Another car will come. 

Some other tips for this are:
  a.	Ask the driver where they are going first – Some drivers may lie about their destination in order to give you a ride. Sometimes they just genuinely want to help you or talk to you, but it can feel shady…
  
  b.	Agree on a destination before setting off. Compare maps and routes. Choose a city, service station or specific point they will drop you at.
          

  3.	Maintain the Conversation - 
Once in the car, talk to your driver as much as you can. I’ve read several accounts of long term long distance hitchhikers who CREDIT their safety to the way they interact with the driver. 
E.g. Thank them for the safe ride, for their kindness; compliment their country & the kindness of the people, ask about their family, etc. 
Be confident. The driver can sense if you feel anxious.

Solo females – If a male driver begins to ask about whether you have a boyfriend, sometimes it is smart to just say yes, even say you are married. Be forward and don’t let anyone make any advances on you. You don’t owe them anything. 

I usually tell a driver I hitchhike alone safely because the country is safe and that I know taekwondo ;)


4.	Track your Location -  
Have your phone on hand. Use GPS and maps to check your route. 
Keep in touch with people who know where you are. You can make your driver aware of this too. 
If you get the chance, take a photo of their car & registration plate.`,
        textThree: `5.	Road Safety -  
Not to be forgotten just because you are riding for free or in someone else's car! Wear the seatbelt. Don’t stand too close to the road. 
I also avoid hitchhiking on corners or where drivers would need to change lanes in order to pull over. 

In some countries it is not illegal to walk on the motorway. In these cases, standing by a toll booth or pull in area is better.


        6.	Nocturnal Hitchhiking -
Overnight hitchhiking can be efficient to reach your destination ready for the morning! Infact, it can be easy to hitchhike at night as long distance trips are often made late at night, particularly by lorry drivers!

If hitchhiking at night, stand in well lit places.  Be very selective in your rides – you don’t want to be stuck at some roadside in the middle of the night. Best to stay at a service station, or get to your exact destination. 
The same applies for hitchhiking in extreme temperatures or bad weather. Apply all the other tips when hitchhiking at night.
        

        7.	Luggage - 
I always sit with my backpack beside me. Even if the driver offers to use the boot space or put the bag in the back, I (politely) refuse. Firstly it’s best to keep things near you in case of a quick getaway. Second to have access to your things like your phone, maps and chargers. I also take my bag with me even if making a short stop over.

Don’t forget your hitchhike sign when you get out, too. Losing the sign can create a big problem in the middle of a trip, as I learnt… twice.
       

       8.	SMILE -
Being friendly when hitchhiking can go a long way. Don’t be afraid to stick to your comfort level. 

Now relax and enjoy hitchhiking safely. Let the next adventure begin!

      content: {
        textOne: `Hitchhiking across Japan SAVED me a lot of money. 
But overnight accommodation could make backpacking expenses add up quickly.
So instead I decided on camping. Or, more specifically, wild camping
I realised that by avoiding these costs, I could afford more and longer travel

So, I bought the cheapest tent I could find ($10 imported from amazon us), borrowed a sleeping bag and roll mat from my university’s mountaineering society, and set off from my Tokyo base in the first week of the February spring holiday.
I do remember Googling the minimum temperature to survive winter camping with summer camping gear. I was definitely not equipped, but that only adds to the adventure!

I planned to visit Tashirojima Island.
But Tashirojima isn’t just any old island, it’s one of Japan’s ‘Cat islands’.
On this cat island, there are more cat residents than human residents!

My adventure on this island became one of my most prominent memories of my travels in Japan… For both good and not-so-good reasons… 


When the boat arrived in Cat Island’s harbour, I felt the same thrill I felt the first time I managed to hitchhike alone.
‘I made it to Cat Island and I am going to camp here!’
I decided to spend the rest of the afternoon playing with the cats and finding a spot to camp
Most the island’s cats are stray, but friendly cats followed me around and accompanied me as I explored.

I discovered collapsed shrines (damaged in the 2011 tsunami), several abandoned houses and various cat ornaments.
It was like exploring a deserted treasure island.          `,
        textTwo: `At one end of the island I came across stripey cat shaped houses right on cliff with a view off the island.
Well, it was immediately clear that this was where I was to set up camp for the night!
I chilled with my new feline friends and took photos.
“This is the life”, I thought

Soon it was nightfall and it became pitch black with no street lamps or nearby buildings. I took a night walk down by the harbour, wandering through the town’s little roads. 
I soaked in the starry sky and cold fresh air, a rarity as I had been living in Tokyo for 6 months!

However, the trek back to my little camp in the darkness didn’t quite have the same feeling
I took wrong turns and found it hard to recognise the right paths.
And to make it spookier, cats were still following me!
A glimpse of reflective eyes staring at me. 
Cat shaped shadows darting past me.
Shrieking meows from all directions.
`,
        textThree: `Finally escaping the demon cat dimension, I arrived back safely at my camp. 
I had to shoo a cat from beneath my tent before I could crawl into my tent!
It was cold
SO cold.

In my sleeping bag, I wore my coat, jacket, two pairs of trousers, thick socks, a second pair socks, a scarf and hat. And I was still freezing. Shivering.

Okay, so maybe it wasn’t the best idea to start my camping expedition in winter.
But added with a chorus of cats wailing and thrashing about outside my tent, the whole situation really seemed like imminent doom.
 “These rabid cats are gonna eat me,” I thought, shivering.
“If I don’t freeze to death first...”
Finally as the sun rose and the air got warmer, I managed to get to sleep and survived the night.

By morning, the monster cats had returned to their usual docile forms.
I packaged up my tent and spent the afternoon hiking across the island back to the harbour.
I passed more abandoned buildings – an abandoned school and an old tourist centre.

The most magical place I discovered on the island was a cat shrine. It was decorated with cat ornaments and little gifts as offerings. 
It really feels enchanting to visit shrines tucked away in forests.
Next time, I’ll take something special to leave there too.

I said goodbye to cats at the harbour and rode the boat back to the main island with a grin and some amazing memories.
The first camp of my hitchhike was complete,
And the adventures were just beginning.`,
